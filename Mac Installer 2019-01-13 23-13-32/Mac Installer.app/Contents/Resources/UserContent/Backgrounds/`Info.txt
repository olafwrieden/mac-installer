How to use the Backgrounds folder:

FUNCTION & PURPOSE
    If you have custom background images, copy them into this folder to become visible to the application.
    You may now set the wallpaper of future Macs to this image (done in the Desktop customisation step of the BYOD Mac Installer).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    1.  Please note that the file extension of your custom background file must be either .png or .jpg to be readable.
    2.  While your file name(s) are totally up to you, the name of this folder and its parent folder(s) must NOT be changed!
