How to use the Manual Installers folder:

FUNCTION & PURPOSE
    This is a folder that can contain any installation files with fail to install as an Automatic Installer.
    Due to security / license agreements prior to opening some .dmg files, they are best installed manually.
    If no .dmg or .pkg files exist in this folder, it will not be displayed upon running the Application Installer component of the BYOD Mac Installer.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    1.  Please note that the file extension of your custom background file must be .dmg or .pkg to be readable.
    2.  While your file name(s) are totally up to you, the name of this folder and its parent folder(s) must NOT be changed!
