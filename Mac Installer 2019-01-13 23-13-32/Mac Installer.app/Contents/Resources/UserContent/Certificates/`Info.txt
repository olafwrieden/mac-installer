How to use the Certificates folder:

FUNCTION & PURPOSE
    If you have custom network certificates, copy them into this folder to become visible to the application.
    You may now install these network certificates on future Macs (done in the Network Certificate step of the BYOD Mac Installer).

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    1.  Please note that the file extension of your custom background file must be .crt to be readable.
    2.  While your file name(s) are totally up to you, the name of this folder and its parent folder(s) must NOT be changed!
