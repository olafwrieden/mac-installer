# Mac Installer

#### What is it?
Using powerful automation, Mac Installer is a portable macOS app, which installs, configures and audits new or existing macs in a matter of minutes. Setting up or maintaining macs can be a tedious task. Why spend precious time looking for critical settings when it can all be collated in one place?

#### From Problem to Inspiration
The Mac Installer originated from the need to configure BYOD Macs in a school environment. Unlike domain controlled macs, BYOD devices are user-owned and vary in compatibility, setting them up with the required software packages had always been a lengthy task, extended by the need to tweak them for productivity and network requirements.

I coded Mac Installer to eliminate the need for hundreds of mouse clicks and Terminal commands just to "get it right". From a technician's perspective, Mac Installer reveals critical (and hidden) preferences all in one place, making the task easier than ever before to maintain consistency. It's automated software installation process allows autonomous installation of virtually any app solely by the installation files you provide.

A tool advanced enough for technicians, yet simple enough to be user friendly, did not exist. Let alone one to set up user-owned devices. So (over several months) I researched, developed, and programmed it - and it saves a lot of time.

## App Overview

#### Launch Screen
The *Launch Screen* is the very first view presented to the user.

#### Device Info and Auditing
View key system information about the current mac and export it, in various level of detail, to your USB drive on-the-go.

#### Adjust Advanced Settings
Many of the Mac's advanced, and often hard-to-find settings have been collated into the application.

## Product Licencing
#### Mac Installer Basic
Single License, designed for the one-man-team. During the initial registration process, Mac Installer is licensed to 1 USB drive of your choosing (can be changed later). Once registered, you can only launch Mac Installer from that USB drive. Cloning the license to additional drives (e.g. to support multiple field technicians) is a feature of the Professional Edition.

#### Mac Installer Professional
The fully featured and unrestricted Mac Installer which can be launched from any location (incl. Network Shares) to serve larger campuses or repair shops. In multi-user / team environments, Mac Installer allows each member (e.g. technician) to have their own USB key using the same Professional license key (in-house distribution).
