How to use the Automatic Installers folder:

FUNCTION & PURPOSE
    If you would like to use the automatic app installation feature, you must supply the corresponding files in this folder.
    Files must be or either .dmg or .pkg files to be visible by the installer. Every file in this folder will be automatically installed in the Application Installation step of the BYOD Mac Installer.
    HINT: Some .dmg files contain a .pkg installer file inside. In which case, simply extract it into this directory and delete the .dmg file in which it was contained.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS
    1.  Please note that the file extension of your custom background file must be .dmg or .pkg to be readable.
    2.  While your file name(s) are totally up to you, the name of this folder and its parent folder(s) must NOT be changed!
